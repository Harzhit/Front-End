Web Pages are designed using : 
    HTML + CSS + Javascript
HTML : for creating structure
CSS : for adding design to the web page
Javascript : for adding logic

Client Server Architecture: 
HTML code is stored in CSA.
User uses browser as client to connect to CSA and then have access. There can be multiple clients.

If content of the website is same of all users then it's a static website
All websites are dynamic nowadays - like facebook, google, etc.

Client side section -> Frontend Side -> Only responsible for handling UI/UX and to show the data to the user
Server side section -> Backend Side -> Has database for storing data and for authentication

What happens when you visit a website?
    All devices connected to internet have a unique IP address
    To connect to google.com -> you need IP address of google.com -> Here comes DNS[Domain Name System]
    I enter the URL -> Browser contacts the ISP for the IP address -> ISP performs the DNS search -> ISP will return the relevant IP address and a connection is established with google.com
